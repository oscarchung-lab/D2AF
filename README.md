### Distortion Map: Distortion Distribution Analysis enabled by Fragmentation (D2AF)
<div align=center><img src=Docs/toc.png  width="400" /></div>

#### (A) Description
D2AF is an efficient, general and flexible fragmentation-based approach for local distortion analysis on various chemical and biological-related molecules. D2AF bases on fragmentation and ONIOM-type boundary strategies to evaluate/estimate (relative) local distortion energies of one (or multiple) structure(s)/conformer(s) (**Tar**; more distortion) relative to the reference structure (**Ref**; less distortion) at the given computational chemistry level (the user adopts). 

**Any type of structures (stationary-point structures: e.g., local minimum, transition state(s); non-stationary-point structures: e.g., MD- or IRC-derived structures) can be adopted as **Tar** and **Ref** and compared in D2AF.**  (Relative) Local distortion energies of all subsystems/fragments for the **Tar** structure(s) relative to the **Ref** structure can be used for visualization (so-called **distortion map** or distortion distribution). 


Fragmentation of subsystems can be defined using three approachs:
* 1. Atomic/fragment resolution (**M1**)
* 2. Individual bond and angle resolution based on internal coordinates (bond, angle, optionlly dihedral) (**M2**)
* 3. Combination of **M1 & M2**  (**M3**), esp. complex systems containing aromatic and/or metal-coordination

    export $ORCA_BIN=/home/username/orca_5.0.0_linux_x86-64/bin
 ``` 
 
Quantum Chemical (QC) calculation packages:
- Gaussian: Gaussian03,09,16
- xTB: xTB-python (not support "calculator=nocalc")
- ANI: torchani  (not support "calculator=nocalc")
- Mlatom: AIQM1 (not support "calculator=nocalc")
- *Any codes are possible through generating their corresponding QC input files from our generated XYZ files for each fragment, running them and extracting energy (in a.u.) by users' script(s) (using "calculator=nocalc" in the D2AF input; see below)* 

#### (D) Usage

*Optional: to check any large diheral difference bewteen the reference and target forms. If detecting any large diheral difference(s), modify **fraglist** for **M1** or add **#include** for **M1 or M2*** e.g.

    check_dihedral ABC-ref.gjf ABC-conf.gjf
    check_dihedral ABC-ref.gjf ABC-conf.gjf thershold(optional)
    
where ABC-ref.gjf & ABC-conf.gjf are any xyz or Gaussian gjf files for the reference and target forms. A value is the thershold (optional) for the large diheral(s) to be printed. 

*Optional: to generate suggestive fragmentation list for **M1 or M3*** e.g.

    autofragment coord

where coord is any xyz file or Gaussian gjf file with/without connectivity. It will generate a new gjf file with connectivity, fraglist for **M1 or M3** as well as a new D2AF template input file (users can modify). No need for **M2**


**To run all proccess: fragmentation, calculations via our calls, and analysis. D2AF input (e.g., ABC.inp) and output (e.g., ABC.dat) E.g.,** 

    D2AF -inp ABC.inp > ABC.dat 

  
*To run fragmentation only; subsequently run/call quantum chemistry calculations (**setting "calculator=nocalc" in the D2AF input file**) by users*

1. Generate fragments, which are then written in **\tmpdir** folder (xyz files with charge and multiplicity in the second line). E.g.,
```       
    D2AF -inp ABC.inp  > ABC.dat
```
    
2. Run QC calculations and extract the energies by users (e.g. running jobs in different machine or a way to use specific QC codes users want).
   
- (a) *run the calculations by users (fragments in **xxx_i.xyz** files generated in the **\tmpdir** folder)*

- (b) *extract the energies to **xxx_i.log** (in a.u. unit; 1st line) for each structure in the **\tmpdir** folder* **Make sure your QC output file names does not have *.log*, (or add the energy to the 1st line of the log files, if you use different QC packages and prefer to use .log as your QC output file names.** Possibly a new keyword would be added to read an external file with a list of energies.  
        
3. Run D2AF again to do analysis only, after the QC results are extracted in the above step 2 by users (**setting "calculator=nocalc" in the D2AF input file**). E.g.,
```         
    D2AF -inp ABC.inp  > ABC_anal.dat
``` 


*To list commands*

    D2AF -h

#### (E) Input preparations/commmand explanations
**ref**: e.g., ABC-ref.gjf, a reference structure (**Ref** form) in a Gaussian file format, containing **method lines**, **cartesian coordinates** and **connectivity**
* the connectivity (bond order) values should be **1.0, 2.0, 3.0** only! 
* **1.5 is forbidden**, it should be modified before running D2AF!
    
**conf**: e.g., ABC-conf.gjf or ABC-conf.xyz, a target structure (gjf or xyz), or multiple target structures in one xyz file (**Tar** form)

**method**: 1 for atomic/framentation-based (**M1**), 2 for bond/angle/diheral based (**M2**; users need to give the diheral list in #include), 3 for 1+2 method (**M3**)

**cpu**: number of cpu for subsystem computation (int)

**pal**: number of paralle subsystem computations (available for Gaussian, xTB; int)

**calculator**: Gaussian (g16, g09), "xTB", "ANI", "AIQM1" for subsystem computations via our call. Alternatively, "nocalc" for calling QC calculations or do analysis by users (seperating fragmentation, calculations and analysis processes) 

**scale**: log/e scale factor for pymol visualization

**fraglist**: **for M1/M3**, define the fragmentation list

**coordination**: **for M3**, define the metal coordination center/region (same listing format as fraglist). Some molecular editors (e.g., Gauview, pymol, VMD) may easily set th coordination sphere and get the list of these atoms involved

**include**: **for M2/M3**, add additional bond(s)/angle(s)/diheral(s) users want. *By default, all diherals are not considered. Users should add the diheral list they want.* 

**exclude**: **for M2/M3**, exclude the bond(s)/angle(s) users want

**charge**: define the formal atomic charge (second value) of the pariticular atom(s) (first value) if not 0 

**spin**: define the formal atomic spin (second value) of the pariticular atom(s) (first value) if not 0 (using integer: spin * 2)


*Currently, if users want to use different link atoms for some specific boundary(ies) they like, users need to manually modify their corresponding QC input files* Possibly, new keywords will be added to modify a few link atoms.



#### (F) Analysis on our generate files :  

 - An excel file (*M1/M2/M3.xlsx) stores all detailed (relative) distortion energy as well as changes (delta) of the coordinates.
 - A few Python scripts display (relative) distortion map (e.g., *M1_frag.pml, *M2_total.pml, *M2_bond.pml, *M2_angle.pml)
 -  A few Python scripts display the difference (delta) of the coordinates (e.g., *bond_delta.pml, *anglep_delta.pml, *anglen_delta.pml). *anglep_delta.pml and *anglen_delta.pml represent the positive and negative changes in the bond angles, respectively.
 -  *frag_show.pml shows fragmentation (e.g. M1).    
 - *Pymol possibly display slim bonds with hydrogen atoms. Users can type "set stick_h_scale, 0.9" and/or "set stick_radius, 0.2" in the Pymol command bar* to modify the H stick thickness and/or the stick radius users like. If users prefer to use their preferred Pymol setting(s), users can add setting commands in their pymol file (.pymolrc.py) Please see Pymol Wiki website (https://pymolwiki.org/)
 - D2AF output (e.g., ABC.dat; cf., the above **(D) Usage section**) lists the key info. Also, a large change/difference in diheral(s) are given/listed in the output file for **the M2/M3 case. By default, (relative) distortion energy for diherals are not considered. If large change/difference in some diherals are found, users should add these diheral list in the "#include" keyword and restart analysis for M2 (running calculations of new diheral fragment(s) only if all old files kept intact) again at the same directory.** Meanwhile, users can **modify the fraglist of the D2AF input to expand the size of the related fragments (including diheral contribution) for the M1/M3 cases and perform new D2AF calculations.** In this case, *restart D2AF* is **NOT recommended for the M1/M3 cases**, as the fraglist (as well as fragments) is changed.      


#### (G) Additional D2AF tools:  

**autofragment.py**  `autofragment`
