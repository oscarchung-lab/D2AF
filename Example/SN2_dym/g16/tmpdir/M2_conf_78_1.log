 A ROPE OVER THE TOP OF A FENCE HAS THE SAME LENGTH ON EACH SIDE.
 WEIGHS 1/3 POUND PER FOOT.  ON ONE END HANGS A MONKEY HOLDING A
 BANANA, AND ON THE OTHER END A WEIGHT EQUAL TO THE WEIGHT
 OF THE MONKEY.  THE BANANA WEIGHS TWO OUNCES PER INCH.
 THE ROPE IS AS LONG AS THE AGE OF THE MONKEY, 
 AND THE WEIGHT OF THE MONKEY (IN OUNCES) IS AS MUCH
 AS THE AGE OF THE MONKEY'S MOTHER.  THE COMBINED AGES OF MONKEY
 AND MOTHER ARE THIRTY YEARS.  HALF THE WEIGHT OF THE MONKEY,
  PLUS THE WEIGHT OF THE BANANA, IS ONE FOURTH AS MUCH AS THE WEIGHT
 OF THE WEIGHT AND THE ROPE.
 THE MONKEY'S MOTHER IS HALF AS OLD AS THE MONKEY WILL BE
 WHEN IT IS 3 TIMES AS OLD AS ITS MOTHER WAS WHEN
 SHE WAS HALF AS OLD AS THE MONKEY WILL BE WHEN IT IS
 AS OLD AS ITS MOTHER WILL BE WHEN SHE IS 4 TIMES AS
 OLD AS THE MONKEY WAS WHEN IT WAS TWICE AS OLD AS 
 ITS MOTHER WAS WHEN SHE WAS ONE THIRD AS OLD AS THE
 MONKEY WAS WHEN IT WAS AS OLD AS ITS MOTHER WAS WHEN 
 SHE WAS 3 TIMES AS OLD AS THE MONKEY WAS WHEN IT WAS AS OLD AS ITS
 MOTHER WAS WHEN SHE WAS 3 TIMES AS OLD AS THE MONKEY 
 WAS WHEN IT WAS ONE FOURTH WAS OLD AS IT IS NOW.
